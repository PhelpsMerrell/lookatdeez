# Quick Fix for Share Handler API

The receive_sharing_intent package API can vary between versions. Let's test which methods work:

## Quick Test Commands:

1. **First, install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd C:\projects\FAANG\lookatdeez
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **If you're still getting errors**, try a different package version in pubspec.yaml:
   ```yaml
   # Try this version instead:
   receive_sharing_intent: ^1.4.5
   ```

3. **Alternative: Use a different package** (if receive_sharing_intent continues to have issues):
   ```yaml
   # Replace receive_sharing_intent with this:
   app_links: ^3.5.1
   ```

## Manual Testing:

Run these commands to check which methods are available:

```bash
flutter doctor
flutter pub deps
```

If the current package doesn't work, I can quickly switch to using `app_links` package which has a more stable API.

## Quick Fix Options:

**Option A: Try older version**
- Change `receive_sharing_intent: ^1.5.1` to `receive_sharing_intent: ^1.4.5`
- Run `flutter pub get`

**Option B: Switch to app_links** 
- I can rewrite the share handler to use `app_links` package instead
- More stable API and better maintained

Which option would you prefer?
